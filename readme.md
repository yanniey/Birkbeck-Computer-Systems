Course Outline

Introduction: Computer architecture (CA) and Operating system (OS) overview 
Processors 
Processes and threads 
Concurrency 
Memory management 
I/O and file systems 
Protection and security 
Distributed and parallel processing


Week 1. Introduction to Computer architecture 
Week 2. Introduction to Operating systems 
Week 3. Problem-solving session. Please try to solve these problems before the session: CA problems (with solutions) and OS problems. 
You may want to test your knowledge of the basics of CA and OS by having a go at this quiz (it is the first time we have a quiz at this module, so there might be initial problems - feedback is welcome). 
Week 4. Instruction sets and processor structure 
Here is a sample Instruction Set Architecture ISA and some pipeline and branching problems. 
CPU simulator CPUsim and some assembly programs (written by Anna Taylor). You can download the simulator from CPUsim java program and the user manual from user manual. 
Week 5. Reduced instruction set computers (RISC) and Superscalar processors slides, and SPARC instruction set. 
Instruction-level parallelism problems: simple pipelined vs superscalar and superscalar.
Week 6. Reading week. Some more computer architecture problems. 
Deadline for coursework Part 1! 
Week 7. Processes and threads slides and Scheduling slides and examples. 
A good introduction to multi-, super- and hyperthreading.
Week 8 and 9. Concurrency slides and animations (written by Vygintas Ranonis). Is Tanenbaum's code deadlock- and starvation free? Another soultion of the dining philosophers problem: Java program from Silberschatz et al.
Week 10. Memory management, MM in Unix and in Win2000.
Week 11. Input/Output . A note on Hamming code and a wikipedia article.
File systems . 
Revision lecture. Main points of the module.
